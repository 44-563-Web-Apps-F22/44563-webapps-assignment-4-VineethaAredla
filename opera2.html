CHORUS
<p class="chorus">     No, he will not contradict you!</p>

<h6 class="lisa">LISA</h6>            
<p class="speech"><pre>  Who am I to raise objection?
    I'm a child, untaught and homely—
    When you tell me you're perfection,
    Tender, truthful, true, and comely—
    That in quarrel no one's bolder,
    Though dissensions always grieve you—
    Why, my love, you're so much older
    That, of course, I must believe you!</pre></p>

CHORUS
 <p class="chorus">        Yes, of course, she must believe you!</p>

CHORUS
<p class="chorus">     If he ever acts unkindly,
    Shut your eyes and love him blindly—
    Should he call you names uncomely,
    Shut your mouth and love him dumbly—
    Should he rate you, rightly—leftly—
    Shut your ears and love him deafly.
    Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!
    Thus and thus and thus alone
    Ludwig's wife may hold her own!</p>
